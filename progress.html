  <h1>Current State of the Art</h1>
  <p>Sheep isn’t just an idea — it’s already running.  
     This page outlines what we’ve built, what’s in progress, and what’s next.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Completed Milestones</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Core Orchestration Engine</h3>
    <p>Built the foundation that manages goal decomposition and interdependent tasks dynamically.  
       Agents can already coordinate on small-scale software operations such as code edits, tests, and documentation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Repository Context Indexer</h3>
    <p>Implemented a semantic indexing system that scans codebases, creates embeddings and metadata,  
       and retrieves relevant files for each task using a local vector store (Chroma / FAISS).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>GitHub Integration (Prototype)</h3>
    <p>Connected Sheep to GitHub for real repositories: it now generates branches, applies AI-generated patches,  
       and opens pull requests ready for human review.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Human Review Layer (MVP)</h3>
    <p>Added an approval interface where human reviewers can inspect, correct, and approve AI-generated work.  
       All feedback is logged and used to continuously train the agents.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>In Progress</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Adaptive Task Network</h3>
    <p>The execution graph can now restructure itself based on results, errors, or new priorities discovered during runtime.  
       This allows Sheep to act like a living project manager, optimizing work as it happens.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Agent-to-Human Communication Nodes</h3>
    <p>Developing specialized “communication agents” that reach out to human teammates on Slack or email when context is missing,  
       ensuring continuous collaboration without bottlenecks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Private Multi-Agent Pool</h3>
    <p>Experimenting with a closed ecosystem of specialized agents (code, QA, documentation, DevOps) that share context and reasoning.  
       Early tests show promising cooperation and reduction in repetitive queries.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Research & Upcoming Goals</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>STEP v4 Dataset Collection</h3>
    <p>Gathering structured logs and review data from Sheep to train the reasoning layer that will power the STEP Protocol.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Early Partner Pilots</h3>
    <p>Preparing pilot programs with two software houses to validate Sheep’s efficiency in real production environments.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Learning from Human Feedback</h3>
    <p>Building the pipeline that transforms human corrections into actionable model fine-tuning data.</p>
  </div>
